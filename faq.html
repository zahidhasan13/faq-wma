                            <h2>How Many Years Do I Have Left On My Old Roof?</h2>
                        </div>
                        <p>This is a question we get asked a lot but there is no standard answer that is always correct. Like many things in life there are variables. The best we can do is provide some guidelines to equip you with reasonable expectations. Just to give you an idea of why this question can be tricky to answer, we've seen 11 year old roofs curling up like tortilla chips and leaking like a spaghetti strainer; and, we've seen roofs installed by the 80 year old homeowner 30 years ago that keep the home drier than saltine crackers. Obviously, every roof and situation is different.</p>

                            <h2>Will I Need A Building
                                Permit For A New Roof?</h2>
                        </div>
                        <p>The short answer is most likely. Our average is about 80% of the time a permit is required. To answer definitively, it depends on the city or township of your home. We can however simplify it for you. If required, it will be part of your proposal automatically when we quote your roof. You'll never have to worry about hidden charges but we can't promise the same thing with other roofers. Even though you won't have to worry about the process, here are a few bits of information you may be interested in knowing about. Most municipalities require a final inspection which we will make you aware of in advance of doing your project. Sometimes, an “open roof inspection” is also required to assure proper compliance under your shingles. No matter what kind of permits and inspections are required, we will have you breathing a sigh of relief you won't have to be concerned about it.</p>

                                Required Permit?</h2>
                        </div>
                        <p>We take care of all permits and arrange any necessary inspections. While we no longer include the permit costs in our estimate due to the large variability of permit costs in the area, we will go over any additional costs incurred by the permits with you. Not only do we have great working relationships with the permit authorities, we are experienced and familiar with pulling permits-less stress for you!

                            If you’ll permit us one little boast, protecting your home during a roofing installation is on our list of things we are most proud of and where we make extra effort to outshine the other roofing companies. Every home is different when it comes to setting up for a new roof so we don’t have a one size fits all answer to this question.
                            <br><br>
                            What we can tell you is that our material haulers we use to transport the materials are loaded up for every job with an arsenal of protective materials: 4×8 sheets of wood, lumber, tarps, and any other materials deemed necessary that we determine during the original inspection of your roof. Extra care is given to the setup before the first crew member ever climbs a ladder to begin your roofing project.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>Absolutely, we actually clean your gutters twice! Your gutters are cleaned by hand after your old roofing material has been torn off, followed by a leaf blower to remove fine debris. After installation of the new roofing material, another cleaning is performed and your gutters are cleaned a second time.</p>

                        <p>We are often asked about our license and insurance which shows that many homeowners are both informed and concerned. You should be. Both are very important and you should ask for proof. A legitimate roofing contractor will not be the least bit offended.</p>

                                Add Home Value?</h2>
                        </div>
                        <p>Short answer is yes. Architectural shingles offer more curb appeal to a home due to the desired look of a high end cedar shake roof along with higher definition colors. Along with the curb appeal, the architectural shingles offer a higher wind resistance than standard architectural shingles and offer better protection in rough weather.</p>

                        <p>Since the picture above provides a spoiler for our answer, allow me to share my experience and reasons for the recommendations we make. Besides, there is no one size fits all answer. We definitely use Owens Corning more than any other shingle, but it’s not always that simple. The fact is, we install many types of shingles from various manufacturers and our hands-on experience with these products is extensive to say the least. When we answer this question upon evaluating your roof, we’ll be able to make a recommendation specifically suited to your needs, budget, and home structure.</p>
